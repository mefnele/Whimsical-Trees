    <h1>The thought behind the Whimsical Trees</h1>

  <p>
        My drawings reflect my fascination with escapism and warped realities.
        I have always enjoyed drawing, designing, and creating. 
        In my leisure time, I use my phone and a stylus pen to 
        create drawings in PENUP, a pre-installed painting app created by Samsung. 
        It’s an awesome program that allows me to bring 
        my imaginative worlds to life through illustration. </p>

<p>When working on my drawings, I dedicate countless hours 
to refine even the smallest 
details—zooming in to the last pixels. 
This adds details that are only noticeable when
viewed up close. I appreciate it when a composition consists of various details. It brings depth to it. 
</p>

<p>When I draw, I immerse myself in these surrealistic scenarios, where 
skies radiate with vibrant hues, trees twist and contort, and objects levitate, converging into the abyss. So I draw them.
The result is fantasy-like imagery — where 
abstraction, fantasy, and reality blend into a whimsical composition. 
That is sort of the whole gimmick of the drawings. It is great that I can utilize my phone to illustrate my reveries. 
And then I needed a platform to present my drawings.</p>

<p>So I decided to program this website using HTML. I chose to use HTML 
because it serves as the foundation of web development. I 
also chose it because of the vast online community, with tutorials and forums that guided me whenever I got stuck. 
I customized it according to my preferred color schemes and text fonts.
I've enjoyed learning how to apply code, much like 
I enjoy refining the details of my drawings. 
Both aspects go hand in hand, as both require patience and meticulousness.  

<p>It is pretty fun to create this gallery, and my programming 
abilities keep growing as I attempt to make alterations. </p>

<p>As I refine my skills, I look forward to
 expanding my gallery of surrealistic drawings. </p>

 <p>Thanks for reading! :D</p>
